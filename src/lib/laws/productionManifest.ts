// MASTER MANIFEST COMPILER — đúng kiến trúc canonical từ hội thoại thiết kế:
//   · 9 tầng KHÔNG bị trộn — mỗi tầng một namespace, có dấu niêm phong __layer
//   · Compiler chỉ GOM + VALIDATE + FREEZE ("người đóng dấu") — không sinh luật,
//     không hiểu scene, không chứa state
//   · Sai dấu tầng → THROW ngay khi module load (không compile được là biết)
//   · Manifest = HIẾN PHÁP (luật bất biến). State (cảnh, nhân vật cụ thể) sống
//     ở breakdown/segments — không bao giờ nằm trong manifest này.
// Tầng 2 (Environment DNA) sống ở src/lib/environment (archetype library) và
// được manifest tham chiếu bằng ID — không copy data vào đây.

DAILY BODY MECHANICS: sitting, standing, entering, leaving, walking to a chair, turning and reaching show real weight transfer — feet step/plant, hips/knees/torso change in order, balance shifts, hands brace only when natural, then the body settles or continues with plausible momentum. CAUSAL CHAIN: every object interaction shows the FULL visible chain — the hand reaches to the object, fingers close on it, it is carried along one continuous path, then released — an object never appears in a hand or changes place without this chain. PROP EXISTENCE: every object used in the motion is already on screen at second 0 (held, worn or placed in the start state, or visibly carried in) — nothing is introduced from nowhere mid-clip. PEOPLE NEVER TELEPORT: every person in the clip is placed in the start state from second 0 or visibly walks in through a real entrance — no one pops into frame or materialises mid-clip. CAUSE BEFORE EFFECT: nothing moves, falls or tips by itself — the visible physical cause makes contact first, the effect follows with real physics timing. ONE LOCATION: the whole clip stays in one continuous space; the background never switches mid-clip. PLACEMENT LOCK: a character's chair/standing mark, seated/standing posture and left-right/front-back relation remain unchanged unless a scripted visible action changes them. SPATIAL TOPOLOGY: freeze ordered zones, connectors, fixed architecture, walkable route, character positions and camera zone before motion; openings stay unobstructed, railings stay only on true exposed edges, and movement crosses zones only through a real connector.";
