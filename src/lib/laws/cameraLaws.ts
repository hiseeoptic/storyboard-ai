    "The camera is a physical observer standing in the space: state its position concretely (angle + distance + height) and append the marker '(thats where the camera is)' after the position",
    "ONE smooth, motivated camera move per clip (slow push-in, gentle pan, slow orbit) — never combine a big camera move with big subject motion",
    "NO camera teleports, NO mid-clip hard cuts: the camera travels continuously, like a real operator's body",
    "Lens continuity: ONE lens for the whole video (from STYLE TOKENS); focal length never changes between clips without a narrative reason",
    "Horizon locked within ±3°; default height is human eye-level (~1.6m) unless a coded angle ([LOW]/[HIGH]/[OVH]) says otherwise",
    "Framing grammar resets attention: progress establish → medium → close within and across clips; camera may observe the speaker, listener reaction or both and never determines who speaks or lip-syncs",
    "Depth of field is natural and consistent with the declared aperture — subject tack-sharp, background falls off realistically",
    "HUMAN-PLAUSIBLE VIEWPOINT: the camera occupies a position a real operator or real rig could occupy — never inside solid objects, never through walls, floors or furniture, never clipping into a character; a POV shot sits at that character's true eye height and looks where their head actually points",
    "CAMERA-TOPOLOGY LOCK: name the camera's zone and line of sight in the same spatial map as the characters; the camera stays on a supported surface/safe side of a boundary and cannot create a view that requires a doorway, railing, wall, person or exterior void to occupy two contradictory positions",
    "PERSPECTIVE GEOMETRY: one consistent perspective per shot — objects shrink correctly with distance, parallel lines converge naturally, near/far scale relationships stay true; no fisheye or anatomy-warping field of view unless the locked visual style explicitly declares it",
    "EYE-LINE TRUTH: characters' eye-lines match the established spatial map — a character looking at someone off-frame looks in that person's true direction; the 180° axis is respected so screen direction never flips mid-conversation",
    "RELATIVE SCREEN DIRECTION LOCK: camera reframes preserve the established left/right seating and standing relationship; never cross the axis in a way that makes characters appear to swap sides unless the script explicitly motivates that camera move",
